This is an overveiw on the project and it's functinality. 
Features with "#" symbol are not to be made in the first version, but in updates.


There need to be 2 main sections, with a header on top

1. header
header needs to contain a name/logo and buttons: Download as pdf, reset, change resume style

2. forms section
this section need to contain various forms, #preferably as a dropdown menu# with categories:
- Personal information with a summary
- hard and soft skills (#maybe i could make a multiple choice menu for hard coding skills and add them to resume as graphics e.g. HTML, CSS, MongoDB etc. )
- education and certificates
- work experience
- projects
- #photo

forms should be prefilled with made up info

3. CV section
Needs to display the cv. It should be prefilled with content and update realtime, when changing forms.
#If a given catrgory is left empty it should not display in resume, and it should still align properly without leaving blank space

#add a button with a choice to have a modern or classic looking resume.


Things to adress:

0. How to link different styles to whole page and the resume itself (2 css files or a class)
1. HTML forms and collectiong data from them
2. displaying the data in the resume
3. Resetting everything with a button
4. Downloading an element from your page as a pdf
